This is my journal of the design and building process of **Arm Claw**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/621).


## 10/18/2025 - I wrote how I wanted to design it, there are two options.  

I was in my bed thinking about how to make the cardboard claw, I am interested heavy in it as I want to make a robot that has these types of claw arms later on when I get the resources or claw arms that strap to my back. I want to go for a 3 fingered claw as it could grab stuff easier but right now I am currently trying a 2 fingered one and see if I can understand that works first before I try the 3 fingered one.

## 10/19/2025 - Made it work, just need to figure out how to make it grab  

So I figured it out, and I made the arm and make it close shut, but I still need to figure out how to make it grab better. Im really proud Ive come this far doing this project and it seems small but spending the time to tweak stuff over 2 hours and like try and make it work especially with the hot glue it was fun and nice.
